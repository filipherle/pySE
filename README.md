# pySE
pySE is a small social-engineering tool made with Python2 and love.

# Introduction

Social engineering, in the context of information security, refers to psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information.

I created this project in order to make it easier for IT's and security experts to social engineer.
